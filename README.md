## How to use:
    1. Run the application (after which you can minimize).
    2. When the app has counted 20 minutes of activity it will maximize itself, set as the top most window and flash red.
    3. When app is instructing you to take a break you must not use the mouse of keyboard for 20 seconds.

    Note: If you are like me and have multiple workstations you can use the network mode to connect your workstations together (up to 10 workstations supported, but only tested up to 3). One computer must be the server (Listen button) and the rest must then be connected to the IP of the Listen server.
